                                        basically refused to
                                        work with my
                                        manager. This was
                                        opportunity to show
                                        what I was made of
                                        and that I could
                                        drive results,
                                        innovate, and
                                        deliver on UX. I was
                                        coming out of a
                                        two-year hiatus that
                                        took me from Cape
                                        Town to Japan to
                                        Colombia, spreading
                                        myself around the
                                        USA Canada and
                                        abroad, spending the
                                        equity [recklessly]
                                        that I reclaimed
                                        after selling the
                                        house that I owned
                                        for almost a decade.

                                        It was time to kick
                                        off the ring rust
                                        and return to the
                                        work force. I was
                                        initially tasked
                                        with The Off Price

                                        along the way
                                        addressed some CSS
                                        bugs. In doing so
                                        the familiar
                                        hodgepodge of CSS
                                        drew my desire to
                                        not only rewrite the
                                        code base but also
                                        to also address some
                                        UX issues that I
                                        noticed.

                                        I wireframed and
                                        prototyped a new
                                        feature
                                        demonstrating the
                                        aggregation of
                                        Errors and Warnings
                                        into a console that
                                        would serve as our
                                        proposal to
                                        introduce the
                                        foundation for the
                                        PRICE Tools

                                        on the UI front.

                                        I envisioned a
                                        multi-tool that
                                        would enable
                                        authorized users to
                                        work across multiple

                                        based off a pattern
                                        library that other
                                        dev teams could draw
                                        inspiration from and
                                        contribute to.

                                        our QA user. He

                                        disgusted but she
                                        loved it and thought

                                        Was “SOO COOL!” as

                                        this new AI will not

                                        and smarter and be
