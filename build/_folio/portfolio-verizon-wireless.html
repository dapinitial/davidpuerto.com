                                    was a genius. He knew
                                    it, I knew it...
                                    Everyone knew it. We
                                    were tasked with a
                                    package delivery content
                                    management tool that he
                                    wasn't too thrilled
                                    about since his skills
                                    far exceeded the
                                    requirement. I was
                                    tasked to come up with
                                    the UX and the UI and
                                    paired to "develop" the
                                    tool with him. After
                                    laying it all out in a
                                    whiteboarding sessions
                                    via sketching I took
                                    pictures an emailed to
                                    everyone. He got to work
                                    immediately with Java,
                                    Struts, and the rest of
                                    his tools... A few days
                                    later he wanted me to
                                    run some SQL commands
                                    that I had no idea about
                                    and then he started to
                                    hit me off with all
                                    sorts of programming
                                    questions that again...
                                    I knew nothing about. He
                                    was furious like, "How
                                    did you get this job?!"
                                    Thinking that I was
                                    going to need to know
                                    everything he did to
                                    pull it off. I kept
                                    telling him just keep on
                                    keep on. Here is the
                                    HTML for the forms, use
                                    this bit of markup in
                                    your code... A week
                                    later he was really
                                    upset because it looked
                                    like crap and I was
                                    designing these screens
                                    that looked nothing like
                                    his and he figured I
                                    couldn’t pull through
                                    with what little I knew
                                    and that he’d be left in
                                    hot seat trying to fix
                                    everything last minute,
                                    late night. The next day
                                    I was like, give me six
                                    hours... and six hours
                                    later our UI was nearly
                                    completed. He came back
                                    and apologized and said
                                    he didn't realize that
                                    that was what I could do
                                    with CSS and jQuery. He
                                    was delighted and
                                    apologized again for his
                                    brash demeanor towards
                                    me and asked why I never
                                    said anything. I just
                                    laughed and said, "I
                                    wanted to see how mad
                                    you could get, I told
                                    you I wasn't a
                                    developer." We went out
                                    for lunch afterwards, he
                                    treated me to Chipotle,
                                    and had a good working
                                    relationship after that.

                                    was working on
                                    prototyping a tablet
                                    experience that I found
                                    to be very likened to
                                    the desktop experience
                                    and suggested we develop

                                    layers together
                                    (HTML/CSS).  After
                                    finishing the prototype
                                    I was asked to circle
                                    back and help with the
                                    desktop version that had
                                    been developed by the
                                    offshore team and to my
                                    dismay I found a site
                                    that in almost no way
                                    shape of form matched
                                    the creative documents.
                                     I was asked to work
                                    with a developer in New
                                    Jersey, CHARLIE (MURPHY)
                                    GROLL, and fix it.  With
                                    Thanksgiving approaching
                                    and a mess of nasty
                                    nested divs and spans
                                    and horrible CSS I told
                                    Charlie calm down, I
                                    have this, despite the
                                    other design team asking
                                    me "What's version
                                    control?" I began to
                                    refactor with a SMACSS
                                    approach and re-laid out
                                    the entire site and then
                                    sent Charlie a copy and
                                    told him to find areas
                                    of the site and we'll
                                    divvy the work out and
                                    begin to refactor based
                                    on the markup and styles
                                    I sent him. A day or so
                                    into it he was livid
                                    thinking we were
                                    screwed. But a few days
                                    later and IE7, 8, 9,
                                    Mozilla, and WebKit all
                                    looking as anticipated
                                    we were almost there. I
                                    had Charlie code up some
                                    STRUTS like I was
                                    familiar with JSTL and
                                    the site was getting
                                    better and better by the
                                    day.  Total win!  Him
                                    and I have kept in touch
                                    since leaving Atlanta,
                                    even though I never met
                                    him, but he's cool and I
                                    hope to race him from NJ
                                    to NYC someday on a
                                    bicycle!

                                    Seattle and he came out
                                    to hang out pre-marriage
                                    with one of them and
                                    about of a dozen of us
                                    went to the Alpine Lakes
                                    Wilderness and hiked to
                                    Dragonstail! I shook
                                    down their gear and
                                    showed them how to get
                                    the most out of a 20L
                                    for a weekend. No reason
                                    to carry a 60L! It's
                                    just 3-4 days on trail!
                                    Charlie's awesome!
