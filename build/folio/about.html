                <!--   <p>When I'm not hiding out from deserting the French Foreign Legion... I swear &mdash; I'm just funnin'! Fun facts though: I was born to a Colombian-immigrant father who was a mechanic-turned nurse-turned physician (when I was 16-21 if you count from when he passed his oral boards) and a mother that was adopted with her twin brother by a cool family who taught me to write letters and practice good penmanship, shuffle, play cribbage, prayed for me daily, and lauded me with tales from the USS Marblehead before she was scrapped. All that while I was growing up, part-time, with my Colombian-Dominican relatives. I lived in seven cities before I was 18 and I think I have lived in seven more? Chicago-proper or Guadalajara were the largest, and Somerset, Kentucky was my favorite before deciding upon Seattle as my home in 2012 when I packed up, left ATL, drove to LA, up the 101, and then lived aboard a boat for a year until my buddy, fresh out of the Army drove my stuff to me from Chicago. What an exemplary human friend! I should probably tell him that. My pasttime was legit skateboarding but how would this intro be complete without sharing my dirtiest secret, not that I met LA the Darkman and we've shared several of the same zipcodes and a chess-game in Grand Rapids, Nashville, or was it Atlanta? But, that I started building websites when I was 13 which has become habit-forming. Bragging rights: I run a 6:15 mile for distance, faster for shorter distances, and I can swim a mile. I crush calisthenics by the hundreds, and I have hung off an airplane's wing strut with my kid brother before letting go unassisted and had to untangle that parachute. Of course my stupid baby brother had a flawless first skydive solo... Whenever my flight lands I'm like... "What a waste of a perfectly good airplane ride!" Now onto the professional stuff: </p> -->
                <p>Over the last decade
                  David Puerto has established a career
                  through the mastery of meaningful,
                  interactive media design.
                  Dedicated to creating refined, yet
                  innovative ecosystems, David Puerto
                  synthesizes complex workflows into
                  extensible UI pattern libraries expressing
                  the underlying design language.
                  Experienced in web-based screen design and
                  nimble along
                  the modern web
                  development toolchain; he prides himself
                  as a seasoned, hands-on UX leader that
                  delivers the highest-level of fit and
                  finish -- thriving on props from
                  brainchild to launch.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>Coming up in the days of Flash I was
                  heavily immersed in interaction and
                  time-based animation along with thinking
                  in terms of scalability and portability. I
                  chose Flash because at the time it was the
                  go-to solution for cross-browser websites
                  with 90% of computers running Flash by
                  default. Along with vector graphics and
                  some ActionScript, Flash was the
                  no-brainer tool for the rich-interactive
                  web experiences of the early and
                  mid-2000s. With the advent of smart
                  devices and tablets I've chosen to fall
                  back to traditional web technologies but I
                  still think in terms of how I can deliver
                  the same scalable, device agnostic
                  experience that I strove for with Flash.
                </p>
                <p>Today I am looking beyond the web as
                  design technology becomes standard in our
                  homes and in our lives. What can I dream
                  up that can help make everyone's lives
                  simpler so that we spend less time hooking
                  things up and more time enjoying the
                  fruits of our labors? You'll see. My hopes
                  is you'll enjoy using it too.</p>

                <div class="clearfix"></div>
                <p>I've been a web hobbyist, enthusiast, and
                  tinkerer for as long as I can remember.
                  I'm all about custom home enhancement
                  projects and I do all my own vehicle
                  repairs and even built my own car. I made
                  the below 67 mustang only start in neutral
                  so it couldn't be stolen by guys like me.
                  Design is all about identifying a problem
                  and offering improvements. Next on the
                  list is buy a wrecked Tesla and mate it to
                  the Mustang Body that I dynacorned into a
                  fastback Eleanor so that I can respect the
                  heritage and enjoy the aesthetics.</p>

                        <p>I practice a LEAN style of UX,
                          close to the metal, working
                          alongside engineers and checking
                          in with design teams for review as
                          iterate over ideas by
                          creating failing fast and filling
                          in those pitfalls often.
                          Prototypes allow for
                          rapidly producing proofs of
                          concept that are functional where
                          UI decisions can be tested and
                          verified. HTML serves as my
                          information architecture, my
                          wireframe, the place where I frame
                          the MVP - that's why it was
                          created. CSS and JavaScript helps
                          craft design around technology
                          enabling me to craft an experience
                          by observing how it all lives
                          together in its natural ecosystem.
                          Oftentimes we make discoveries
                          early on in our prototyping that
                          lend to a better overall user
                          experience and becomes a creative
                          solution we otherwise may have
                          missed designing a static
                          document, especially when
                          designing for big data problems
                          where we might need to test 100
                          columns and 100000 rows of data.
                          You cannot mock that up in static
                          design software. You can't. You
                          wouldn't even try. Right tool for
                          the right job.</p>

                          Thinking in terms of how it will
                          be assembled, all the way through
                          to how the user will actually be
                          holding it in their hand or using
                          the mouse, ensures that each
                          decision I make is conscientious
                          of our platform. I've always been
                          an admirer of clean, sleek, and
                          dark interfaces that feel very

                          Oftentimes there are things that I
                          can do with CSS that would
                          typically take hundreds of lines
                          of a classical programming
                          language to accomplish and when I
                          can be an asset to engineering and
                          get applause for a clever solution
