                            the twelve week springboard to
                            joining
                            an Engineering
                            at the Facebook and where

                            out to learn about and produce
                            measurable results as we
                            produced solutions based on

                            To begin we ensured that we have
                            places to document internally
                            and correspond with our users.
                            This came in the internal FB
                            WIKI and through Secret Groups
                            targeting our users.

                        <p>
                            After setting up our sandbox for
                            correspondance and documentation
                            I tasked myself to reach
                            out to
                            the users and created personas
                            identifying people by name, job
                            title, team, responsibilities,
                            etc. All of my initial users
                            were Facebook engineers and data
                            scientists. As this project grew
                            in scope to the point of open
                            sourcing we looked at potential
                            users from designers who used
                            code to young students and
                            hoobyists.</p>

                            To identify the users to query I
                            used
                            SCUBA to deep dive into Facebook
                            data to
                            determine who were the most
                            active users
                            and then ran queries over the
                            last
                            twelve months to determine who
                            had been
                            an active user that was no
                            longer using
                            FBIDE to determine where we were
                            failing
                            and how we could win them back.
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            From there I set up web chats
                            with users
                            from various engineering teams
                            and data
                            scientists
                            with varying usage over the last
                            year
                            some were
                            power users and some left it for
                            dead
                            when they
                            left boot camp. I organized a
                            Facebook
                            group
                            and began correspondances.</p>
                        <br />

                        <p>

                            To announce my presence and what
                            we were
                            doing
                            I created flyers and
                            placed
                            them in
                            common
                            areas and even in the bathrooms
                            with the
                            urinals.
                            I was the Bathroom DJ and I
                            played the
                            music to
                            lessen the burder of the bodily
                            noises
                            that were
                            expressed -- but that's another
                            story.</p><br />
                        <p>
                            I began to hang out with the
                            engineers
                            and was
                            using a myriad of IDEs that they
                            enjoyed
                            using
                            began learning to write tests
                            and
                            understand
                            the why behind how engineers are
                            working. It was
                            not only insightful, it was
                            enlightening. I
                            developed a deep appreciation
                            and
                            respect,
                            a camaraderie so-to-speak with
                            engineers
                            across
                            the globe. I was even shouted
                            out on
                            Facebook Video
                            by engineers who were in some
                            respects
                            idols and
                            rocks star developer advocates
                            within
                            the company.
                            People were really excited about
                            what we
                            were working on, Engineers like
                            Kent
                            Beck who people studied about in
                            CompSci classes was on staff and
                            praised my advances by
                            name in one such video. It was
                            humbling as
                            more and more Facebook employees
                            began
                            to know
                            David Puerto as
                            friend of the
                            developers and
                            their advocated their best
                            interests from the Design Lens.

                            Some of the unexpected findings
                            were
                            that
                            there were a lot of features
                            already in
                            development
                            that were buried or just had not
                            been
                            released during
                            the beta releases of the IDE
                            that were demoed in early
                            bootcamps where they tried to
                            get some more developer interest
                            and participation to create the
                            best cloud-based IDE in the
                            wild.

                            Bringing
                            the users back
                            was as simple as showing them
                            what was
                            possible and
                            turning them onto the sleek new
                            interface that allowed
                            for their workflow to remain
                            consistent
                            and not impeeded
                            by a UI. Many developers are
                            straight up
                            typing magic.
                            They know it as well as anyone
                            knows any
                            language. It
                            is amazing to watch them work.

                            I noticed a lot of time was
                            spent
                            jumping back and forth between
                            terminal tabs, build systems,
                            IDEs,
                            terminals Gitub, Phabricator,

                            management
                            systems and of course Facebook
                            because who needs Slack when you
                            have
                            Facebook Gold? These
                            observations culiminated in
                            feature requests that we spec'd
                            as a team in charge of our own
                            destiny and be began to assemble
                            the ground work that was led by
                            Design that influenced the
                            engineering tools. I had some
                            Product Designers joshing that
                            I was designing the DevTool but
                            they were seeing the results and
                            witnessing the coolness coming
                            out of our team as well as the
                            response from the developers
                            internally and on the team that
                            we were moving by leaps and
                            bounds in the right direction. I
                            even had the company rocking the
                            cool t-shirt. We were buzzing
                            from Seattle to Tel Aviv and not
                            just off the secret in the
                            globe.

                        <p>
                            I decided to build in-line
                            commenting
                            into the Diff View where
                            engineers view differences
                            between code
                            to see what changed
                            between one commit and another.
                            Super
                            powerful feature as is...
                            but now we decided to pivot,
                            because,
                            what if you were slacking
                            off in Facebook and you
                            committed some
                            code that botched the
                            MobilePerformance in the
                            labratory and
                            16 of the 300 devices that
                            your code was running on slowed
                            performance? What if we could
                            automate
                            the review process and your
                            manager or
                            whoever the code reviewer was
                            received a
                            Facebook Alert that someone's
                            code blew
                            up something somewhere? What if
                            they
                            recevied that alert in their own
                            Facebook, could click that
                            alert, jump
                            into
                            the code right in facebook, see
                            the
                            DiffView, compare the code in
                            question
                            identify an area for refactor,
                            and then
                            could inline comment in Facebook
                            fashion
                            to: "Slow down and fix your
                            shit!" Then
                            the developer who needed to redo
                            their
                            work would receive an update on
                            their
                            end, could jump back into their
                            code,
                            fix it and commit it and push it
                            for a
                            pull request all in the same
                            work flow
                            in the same window? After we
                            implemented
                            this and began to measure how
                            long it
                            took on average for people to
                            complete
                            these tasks we were able to show
                            how
                            this process improvement alone
                            was
                            saving on average 6 hours of
                            developer
                            time each week. Times thousands
                            of
                            developers. Times the amount of
                            money
                            each one is being paid per hour.
                            You do
                            the math. It's in the millions
                            that
                            feature was saving alone.</p>

                            Another problem our cloud-based
                            zero-install IDE sought to solve
                            was remotely debugging other
                            people's sandboxes. This was
                            accomplished and implemented and
                            still is one of the best
                            features for this product...

                            We were developing themes and we
                            had a
                            listener
                            to inform us of what people were
                            using
                            for their
                            preferred themes and were able
                            to narrow
                            it down
                            to four themes. Then I created
                            our own
                            Light and Dark theme to really
                            enhance
                            our UI because, well, that's a
                            place I
                            enjoy geeking out on. I'm a

                            This was
                            an incredibly fun project to
                            begin as
                            FBIDE has ~1000 active users who
                            are
                            internally using the cloud-based
                            IDE to
                            develop and debug code on the
                            HHVM in
                            Hack and best of all languages
                            are
                            supported. FBIDE is demoed to
                            boot
                            campers and interns alike. I
                            found that
                            many people when I started the
                            project
                            had tried it out and switched
                            back to
                            their preferred methods of
                            programming.
                            Upon inquiry I learned that many
                            VIM and
                            eMacs users were going to be
                            hard to
                            convert... unless of course we
                            have VIM
                            and VIM-style key mapping!! So
                            we
                            entered that as a task and
                            delivered!
                            Observing the entire Facebook
                            developer
                            life cycle I was able to extract
                            the
                            basis from which move developers
                            begin
                            and enter and continue and
                            finish
                            programs and their overall
                            workflow
                            including expected feedback
                            loops.
                            Having an active user base and
                            users who
                            were active in our internal
                            Facebook
                            group made for an amazing UX
                            experience
                            querying users and responding to
                            comments. When I started to
                            implement
                            some of the changes literally
                            hundreds
                            of posts were made with such
                            excitement
                            for the enhanced UI experience.
                            I've
                            never been on a project where
                            the users
                            were currently dogfooding the
                            product
                            and it definitely enhanced the
                            outcome
                            by ensuring that every step we
                            made was
                            in the right direction with our
                            users
                            Q&Aing the product for us so we

                        <p>
                            The work from Lyric is now being
                            ported
                            over to another open-source IDE
                            and
                            being co-developed internally
                            with
                            another group called `Nuclide`
                            that I am
                            currently on contract with. We
                            are
                            contributing directly to the
                            GitHub Atom
                            core. Today the entire
                            experience is
                            serving as a living prototype
                            that the
                            users are still using while we
                            put the
                            polish on Nuclide being demoed
                            at F8.</p><br />
                        <p>
                            Update. After contributing to
                            GitHub's Atom Core, GitHub's
                            Atom won open-source product of
                            the year. Nuclide is now
                            retired.
                            There is a
                            long and taried history. A lot
                            of
                            political drama, and even a
                            hackathon
                            project, Atom in Orbit, that I
                            distinctly remember suggesting
                            be the
                            direction we go to find a happy
                            medium,
                            keep FBIDE code named Lyric
                            growing in
                            the right direction, and
                            satisfying
                            open-source by redoing it in
                            JavaScript.
                            We just needed to port Atom from
                            the
                            Electron app back to the
                            browser. It was
                            all DOM. No biggie... Oh well.
                            Such is
                            the life in the software game.
